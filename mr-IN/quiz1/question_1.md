You have used a lot of `if` statements to control your game's behaviour. Some of them might have had more complex conditions, using `and` to make multiple tests at once. If you ran the following piece of conditional code, what would you expect the output to be?

```python
score = 5000
lives = 2

if score >= 5000 and lives >= 3:
  print('Great flying!')

if score >= 5000: 
  print('Doing well!')
  if lives > 1:
    print('Keep going!')
  else:
    print('But be careful!')

elif lives > 1:
  print('Push harder!')

else:
  print('Head for base!')
```

Great flying!

While `score >= 5000` is true, for an `and` condtion both parts must be true, and `lives >= 3` is false.

Doing well!
Keep going!

This is correct — `score >= 5000` is true, and so is `lives > 1` on the nested `if` statement.

Doing well!

Close, but `score >= 5000` isn't the only condition the program would find true as it ran.

```
Push harder!

While `lives > 1` is true, only the code inside the first true condition in an `if`/`elif`/`else` statement is executed, and `lives > 1` is not the first condition that is true.
