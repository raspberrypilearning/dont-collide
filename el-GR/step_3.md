Define a `draw_obstacles` function to draw a cactus emoji 🌵.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 12
line_highlights: 13-14
---

# Draw obstacles function goes here
def draw_obstacles(): text('🌵', 200, 200)

--- /code ---

Call the `draw_obstacles` function so that the cactus is drawn on the screen.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 22
line_highlights: 27
---

def draw():   
# Put code to run every frame here global safe safe = Color(200, 100, 0) background(safe) draw_obstacles() draw_player()

--- /code ---

--- /task ---


--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code and you should see a cactus as well as your player.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add two variables to keep track of the obstacle's x and y coordinates. Update the code to draw the emoji so that it uses these variables.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 13
line_highlights: 14-16
---

def draw_obstacles(): obstacle_x = 200 obstacle_y = 200 text('🌵', obstacle_x, obstacle_y)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now, add `frame_count` to the obstacle's y (vertical) position.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 13
line_highlights: 15
---

def draw_obstacles(): obstacle_x = 200 obstacle_y = 200 + frame_count text('🌵', obstacle_x, obstacle_y)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code and the cactus emoji should move down the screen until it reaches the bottom.
