## Rilevamento delle collisioni

Ora puoi impostare il tuo giocatore in modo che reagisca alla collisione con un ostacolo.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Rilevamento collisioni**</span> determina quando due oggetti creati in una simulazione al computer â€”
che sia un gioco, un'animazione o qualcos'altro â€” si toccano. Esistono diversi modi per farlo, ad esempio: 
  - controllare se i colori che appaiono nella posizione di un oggetto sono i colori di quell'oggetto o uno diverso
  - tenere traccia della forma di ogni oggetto e controllare se quelle forme si sovrappongono
  - creare una serie di punti di confine, o linee, attorno a un oggetto e controllare se entrano in contatto con altri oggetti 'collidabili'
Quando tali collisioni vengono rilevate, il programma puÃ² reagire in qualche modo. In un videogioco, questo di solito serve per infliggere danni (se il giocatore si scontra con un nemico o un pericolo) o per fornire un vantaggio (se il giocatore collide con un potenziamento).

In your `draw_player()` function, create a variable called `collide` and set it to get the hexadecimal (hex) colour value at the position of the player.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_player()
---

    collide = get(mouse_x, player_y).hex

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create a condition to check `if` the `collide` variable is the same as the `safe` variable â€” if it is, then your player is safely touching the background and has not collided with an obstacle.

Move your code to draw your player inside your `if collide == safe` condition and add code in the `else` statement to get the player to react to the collision.

**Choose:** How should your player react? You could:
+ Use a different emoji for the player
+ You could use `tint()` to change the appearance of an image, don't forget to call `no_tint()` after drawing the image

title: Use emoji characters

You can use emoji characters in the p5 `text()` function to represent your collided player.

Here's an example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
---

def setup(): size(400, 400) text_size(40)  # Controls the size of the emoji text_align(CENTER, TOP)  # Position around the centre

--- /code ---

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_player()
---

def draw_player(): if collide == safe.hex:  # On background text('ðŸŽˆ', mouse_x, player_y) else:  # Collided text('ðŸ’¥', mouse_x, player_y)

**Test:** Check if a collision is detected and the reaction takes place each time a collision occurs.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

--- collapse ---
---
title: There is no collision when the player reaches an obstacle
---

If your player character touches the obstacle and nothing happens, there are a few things you should check:

 - Make sure you call `draw_obstacles()` before `draw_player()`. If you check for collisions before drawing the obstacles in a frame, then there won't be any obstacles to collide with!
 - Make sure you are using the exact same colour when drawing the object and in the `if` statement checking for the collision. You can make sure of this by using the same `global` variable in both places.
 - Are you drawing the player character before checking the colour at the mouse coordinates? If so, you are only ever going to get the colours from the player. You need to check the colour first and **then** draw the player.
 - Do you have code in the `else` part to do something different when a collision is detected, such as applying a tint or using an emoji?
 - Have you correctly indented the code for your `if` statement so it runs when the condition is met?

Printing the colour of the pixel you are checking for a collision can be useful:

```python
    print(red(collide), green(collide), blue(collide))
```

You can also print a circle around the point you are checking and adjust the point you check if you need to:

```python
    no_fill()
    ellipse(mouse_x, player_y, 10, 10)  # Draw collision point
```

--- /task ---

**Optional:** At the moment, you are just detecting collisions at one pixel on your player. You could also detect collisions at other pixels at the edge of your player, such as the bottom or left- and right-most edges.

title: Collision detection with multiple pixels
---

```python
def draw_player():

    player_y = int(height * 0.8)
    # Useful for debugging
    # Draw circles around the pixels to check for collisions

    no_fill()
    ellipse(mouse_x, player_y, 10, 10)  # Draw collision point
    ellipse(mouse_x, player_y + 40, 10, 10)
    ellipse(mouse_x - 12, player_y + 20, 10, 10)
    ellipse(mouse_x + 12, player_y + 20, 10, 10)

    collide = get(mouse_x, player_y).hex
    collide2 = get(mouse_x - 12, player_y + 20).hex
    collide3 = get(mouse_x + 12, player_y + 20).hex
    collide4 = get(mouse_x, player_y + 40).hex

    if mouse_x < width:  # Off the left of the screen
        collide2 = safe.hex

    if mouse_x > width:  # Off the right of the screen
        collide3 = safe.hex

    if collide == safe.hex and collide2 == safe.hex and collide3 == safe.hex and collide4 == safe.hex:
        text('ðŸŽˆ', mouse_x, player_y)
    else:
        text('ðŸ’¥', mouse_x, player_y)
```

You could even use a loop and check lots of different pixels. This is how collision detection works in games.
