## Collisions

Recall that in the first step you created a 'safe' colour.

--- task ---

Create a variable to store the colour the player emoji is currently touching.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 8
line_highlights: 9
---

def draw_player(): player_on = get(mouse_x, 320).hex text('ðŸ¤ ', mouse_x, 320)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

If the player is touching the safe colour, draw the player emoji. If it is not, draw an explosion emoji to show they have crashed.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 8
line_highlights: 10, 12-13
---

def draw_player(): player_on = get(mouse_x, 320).hex if player_on == safe.hex: text('ðŸ¤ ', mouse_x, 320) else:  
text('ðŸ’¥', mouse_x, 320)

**Test:** Run your code and move the player. You should see the explosion emoji if your player touches an obstacle.

Make sure that in `draw()`, the line of code to `draw_obstacles()` is before `draw_player()`. If you check for collisions before drawing the obstacles in a frame, then there wonâ€™t be any obstacles to collide with!
