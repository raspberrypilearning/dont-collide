## Lots of obstacles

Now you will add code to make lots of obstacles to avoid.

--- task ---

Add a loop and indent the code to draw an obstacle. The loop will run this code multiple times.

language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 13
line_highlights: 15-19

def draw_obstacles(): seed(1234) for i in range(8): obstacle_x = randint(0, screen_size) obstacle_y = randint(0, screen_size) + frame_count obstacle_y = obstacle_y % screen_size text('ðŸŒµ', obstacle_x, obstacle_y)

--- /code ---

Make sure that the code for the seed is before the loop, otherwise all of your obstacles will be generated on top of each other!

--- task ---

Change the number inside `range()` to control how many obstacles are created.
