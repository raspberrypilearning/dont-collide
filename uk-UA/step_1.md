## You will make

Build a scrolling endless runner game where your character has to avoid obstacles.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> 
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Endless runners**</span> are a type of game where you have to avoid obstacles and the game only ends when you hit an obstacle. You score points by staying alive for as long as you can.</p>

You will:
+ Use game **conditions** to control what happens
+ Learn about procedural generation and collision detection
+ Personalise a game to your interests

Run these examples. Think about how the players and obstacles have been made.

What happens if you hit an obstacle? Does it get harder as you play?
