## Detec√ß√£o de colis√£o

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">

Os jogos de corredor sem fim geralmente terminam quando o jogador colide com um obst√°culo.

Agora voc√™ pode configurar seu jogador para reagir √† uma colis√£o de obst√°culos.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Detec√ß√£o de colis√£o**</span> determina quando dois objetos criados dentro de uma simula√ß√£o de computador ‚Äî seja um jogo, uma anima√ß√£o ou qualquer outra coisa ‚Äî est√£o se tocando. Existem v√°rias maneiras de fazer isso, por exemplo: 
  - verificando se as cores que aparecem no local de um objeto s√£o as cores desse objeto ou outras
  - acompanhando a forma de cada objeto e verificando se essas cores formas se sobrep√µem
  - criando um conjunto de pontos de limite, ou linhas, ao redor de um objeto e verificando se eles entram em contato com quaisquer outros objetos 'colid√≠veis'
Quando tal colis√£o √© detectada, o programa pode reagir de alguma forma. In a video game, this is usually to deal damage (if the player collides with an enemy or hazard) or to give a benefit (if the player collides with a power up).

In your `draw_player()` function, create a variable called `collide` and set it to get the hexadecimal (hex) colour value at the position of the player.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_player()
---

    collide = get(mouse_x, player_y).hex

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create a condition to check `if` the `collide` variable is the same as the `safe` variable ‚Äî if it is, then your player is safely touching the background and has not collided with an obstacle.

Move your code to draw your player inside your `if collide == safe` condition and add code in the `else` statement to get the player to react to the collision.

**Choose:** How should your player react? You could:
+ Use a different emoji for the player
+ You could use `tint()` to change the appearance of an image, don't forget to call `no_tint()` after drawing the image

title: Use emoji characters
---

You can use emoji characters in the p5 `text()` function to represent your collided player.

Here's an example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
---

def setup(): size(400, 400) text_size(40)  # Controls the size of the emoji text_align(CENTER, TOP)  # Position around the centre

--- /code ---

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_player()
---

def draw_player(): if collide == safe.hex:  # On background text('üéà', mouse_x, player_y) else:  # Collided text('üí•', mouse_x, player_y)

--- /code ---

**Test:** Check if a collision is detected and the reaction takes place each time a collision occurs.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

--- collapse ---
---
title: There is no collision when the player reaches an obstacle
---

If your player character touches the obstacle and nothing happens, there are a few things you should check:

 - Make sure you call `draw_obstacles()` before `draw_player()`. Se voc√™ verificar as colis√µes antes de desenhar os obst√°culos em um quadro, n√£o haver√° nenhum obst√°culo para colidir!
 - Certifique-se de usar exatamente a mesma cor ao desenhar o objeto e verificar a colis√£o na instru√ß√£o `if`. Voc√™ pode ter certeza disso usando a mesma vari√°vel `global` em ambos os lugares.
 - Voc√™ est√° desenhando o jogador antes de verificar a cor nas coordenadas do mouse? Nesse caso, voc√™ s√≥ obter√° as cores do jogador. Voc√™ precisa verificar a cor primeiro e **depois** desenhar o jogador.
 - Do you have code in the `else` part to do something different when a collision is detected, such as applying a tint or using an emoji?
 - Voc√™ identou o c√≥digo corretamente para sua instru√ß√£o `if` para que seja executado quando a condi√ß√£o for atendida?

Printing the colour of the pixel you are checking for a collision can be useful:

```python
    print(red(collide), green(collide), blue(collide))
```

You can also print a circle around the point you are checking and adjust the point you check if you need to:

```python
    no_fill()
    ellipse(mouse_x, player_y, 10, 10)  # Draw collision point
```

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Optional:** At the moment, you are just detecting collisions at one pixel on your player. You could also detect collisions at other pixels at the edge of your player, such as the bottom or left- and right-most edges.

title: Collision detection with multiple pixels
---

```python
def draw_player():

    player_y = int(height * 0.8)
    # Useful for debugging
    # Draw circles around the pixels to check for collisions

    no_fill()
    ellipse(mouse_x, player_y, 10, 10)  # Draw collision point
    ellipse(mouse_x, player_y + 40, 10, 10)
    ellipse(mouse_x - 12, player_y + 20, 10, 10)
    ellipse(mouse_x + 12, player_y + 20, 10, 10)

    collide = get(mouse_x, player_y).hex
    collide2 = get(mouse_x - 12, player_y + 20).hex
    collide3 = get(mouse_x + 12, player_y + 20).hex
    collide4 = get(mouse_x, player_y + 40).hex

    if mouse_x < width:  # Off the left of the screen
        collide2 = safe.hex

    if mouse_x > width:  # Off the right of the screen
        collide3 = safe.hex

    if collide == safe.hex and collide2 == safe.hex and collide3 == safe.hex and collide4 == safe.hex:
        text('üéà', mouse_x, player_y)
    else:
        text('üí•', mouse_x, player_y)
```

You could even use a loop and check lots of different pixels. This is how collision detection works in games.
