### Comece com um obst√°culo

Voc√™ pode criar obst√°culos da mesma forma que criou o seu jogador. Como os obst√°culos se encaixam no seu tema?

Voc√™ vai usar uma itera√ß√£o `for` para fazer muitas c√≥pias, ent√£o voc√™ s√≥ precisa fazer ou escolher um obst√°culo.

--- task ---

Defina uma fun√ß√£o `desenhar_obstaculos()`:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - draw_obstacles() line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights: 4
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2 text('üåµ', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

--- /code ---

Adicione o c√≥digo √† func√£o `draw()` para chamar `desenhar_obstaculos()` em cada quadro.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - draw() line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights: 5
---

def draw(): global safe safe = Color(200, 100, 0)  # Add the colour of your theme background(safe) draw_obstacles()  # Before drawing the player draw_player()

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Escolha:** Qual √© a apar√™ncia do seu obst√°culo? Seu obst√°culo pode ser:
+ Uma imagem fornecida no projeto inicial
+ Um emoji üéà ou texto
+ Desenhe usando uma s√©rie de formas

--- collapse ---
---
t√≠tulo: Use uma imagem inicial
---

Images included in the starter project will be shown in the `Image gallery`.

![The Image gallery displaying the included images.](images/starter-images.png)

Make a note of the name of the image you want to use.

Load the image into the `setup()` function

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - setup() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 9
line_highlights: 12
---

def setup(): size(400, 400) global player player = load_image('skiing.png')  # Load your player image obstacle = load_image('rocket.png')  # Load your obstacle image

--- /code ---

Find the line `# Keep this to run your code`. Before that line, define a new `draw_obstacles()` function, call `obstacle` as a global variable and use it in the call to `image()`.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2

    global obstacle
    
    image(obstacle, ob_x, ob_y, 30, 30)  # Resize to fit your theme

--- /code ---

t√≠tulo: Use caracteres emoji
---

You can use emoji characters in the p5 `text()` function to represent your obstacles.

Here's an example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
---

def setup(): size(400, 400) text_size(40)  # Controls the size of the emoji text_align(CENTER, TOP)  # Position around the centre

--- /code ---

Find the line `# Keep this to run your code`. Before that line, define a new `draw_obstacles()` function.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2 text('üåµ', ob_x, ob_y)

--- /code ---

**Tip:** You can use several simple shapes in the same function to create a more complex obstacle.

### Mova o seu obst√°culo

--- task ---

Now add code to increase the `y` position of the obstacle each frame, and have it wrap around when it gets to the bottom to create the effect of another obstacle.

The p5 `frame_count` variable starts counting the frames when you click run.

`ob_y %= height` sets the `y` position to the remainder when divided by `height`. With a `height` of '400', this will turn `401` into `1` so when the obstacles goes off the bottom of the screen, it reappears at the top.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2 + frame_count  # Increases each frame ob_y %= height  # Wrap around text('üåµ', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

### Muitos obst√°culos

You could draw lots of copies of your obstacle at different starting locations but that's quite a lot of work. Let's use a shortcut.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> 
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Procedural generation**</span> is used in the creation of game worlds, obstacles, and movie scenes to create randomness but with certain rules applied. A <span style="color: #0faeb0">seed</span> means you can generate the same results every time you use the same seed.</p>

--- task ---

This code uses a `for` loop with `randint()` to choose obstacle positions for you. Calling the random `seed()` function first means that you will always get the same random numbers. This means that the obstacles won't jump around every frame and you can change the seed until you get one that positions the obstacles fairly.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): seed(12345678)  # Any number is fine

    for i in range(6):  
        ob_x = randint(0, height)
        ob_y = randint(0, height) + frame_count
        ob_y %= height
        text('üåµ', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

t√≠tulo: Aviso de epilepsia

Testing your program has the potential to induce seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. If you have photosensitive epilepsy or feel you may be susceptible to a seizure, do not run your program. Instead, you can:
- Certifique-se de ter adicionado a linha de c√≥digo `seed()` para garantir que seus obst√°culos n√£o pulem
- Pe√ßa a algu√©m para execut√°-lo para voc√™
- Siga em frente e conclua o projeto, pedindo a algu√©m para execut√°-lo no final para que voc√™ possa depurar
- Slow the game down by using `frame_rate = 10` in your call to `run()` like this:

```python
run(frame_rate = 10)
```
You can alter the speed of the game by changing `10` to a higher or lower value.

--- /collapse ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your program and you should see multiple objects on the screen, wrapping around when they get to the bottom.

Change your code until you are happy with the obstacles you have. You can:

+ Mude a semente para obter obst√°culos em diferentes posi√ß√µes iniciais
+ Altere o n√∫mero de vezes para repetir a itera√ß√£o para obter um n√∫mero diferente de obst√°culos
+ Ajuste o tamanho dos obst√°culos

**Tip:** Make sure it is possible to avoid your obstacles but that there is no easy path through your game.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

t√≠tulo: Apenas um obst√°culo est√° sendo desenhado
---

Check your function that draws multiple obstacles:
 + Certifique-se de usar uma itera√ß√£o `for` para chamar a fun√ß√£o de desenho de obst√°culo mais de uma vez
 + Certifique-se de usar `randint()` para alterar as coordenadas (x, y) que est√° passando para a fun√ß√£o de desenho de obst√°culo
 + Verifique se voc√™ usou `ob_x` e `ob_y` como coordenadas para o seu obst√°culo

For example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py ‚Äî draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): seed(12345678)

    for i in range(6):  
        ob_x = randint(0, height)
        ob_y = randint(0, height) + frame_count
        ob_y %= height
        text('üåµ', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

t√≠tulo: Os obst√°culos mudam de posi√ß√£o toda vez que um quadro √© desenhado

Make sure that you have used `seed()` inside the function that draws multiple obstacles.

Programmers use lots of neat tricks like using the `%` operator to make objects wrap around the screen and the `seed()` function to generate the same random numbers. The more coding you do, the more neat tricks you will learn.</p>
